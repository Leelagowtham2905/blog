<img src="./image 2.jpg" alt="childhood pic" width="15%" />

<p style="text-align: left;">Virat Kohli is one of India's most celebrated cricketers,</br> known for his intense passion, exceptional batting skills, and leadership abilities. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, Kohli showed early promise as a cricketer, joining the West Delhi Cricket Academy at the age of nine.</br>He made his first-class debut for Delhi in 2006, and shortly after, he led the India U-19 team to victory in the ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup in 2008.</p>
</br>
<h2><b><u>CHILDHOOD</u></b></h2>
<img src="./image3.webp" alt="DADS PIC" width="15%"/>
<p style="text-align: left;">Virat Kohli had a close and deeply influential relationship with his father, Prem Kohli, who played a crucial role in shaping his early years in cricket. Growing up in Delhi, Virat was encouraged by his father to pursue cricket seriously. Prem Kohli worked as a criminal lawyer, and despite not being wealthy, he made every possible sacrifice to support Virat's dreams. From enrolling him in the **West Delhi Cricket Academy** to attending every match he played, his father was a constant presence in his life and career.</br>

    One poignant memory that deeply affected Virat was the loss of his father when he was only 18 years old. In 2006, while he was playing a Ranji Trophy match for Delhi, his father passed away suddenly due to a stroke. Despite this immense personal tragedy, Virat showed incredible dedication; he returned to the field the next morning and scored 90 runs to save his team from a difficult position. This incident became a defining moment in his career, showcasing his resilience and determination.</br>
    
    Kohli often recalls his father’s influence, describing him as a “self-made man” who instilled values of hard work, discipline, and honesty. His father’s memory has served as a source of motivation throughout his career, and Virat has said he strives to make his father proud with every achievement on and off the field.</p> </br>
